# Task-0001: Initial Project Setup

## Description
Set up the initial project structure and configuration for cross-compiling C++ code.

## Objectives
- Create the basic project directory structure
- Set up build system configuration with bash scripts
- Create Docker configuration for Linux x86_64 and ARM64
- Document the cross-compilation requirements

## Acceptance Criteria
- Project structure is established
- Bash build scripts are created for cross-compilation
- Docker configuration is in place for Linux x86_64 and ARM64
- Basic documentation is in place

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This is the first task for the Cross Compile C++ Example project. As per project requirements, we will use bash scripts instead of CMake for the build system, and Docker for containerization.

## Constraints
- Use Clang compiler with C++ 23 standard or newer
- Bash scripts for build system (no CMake)
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
