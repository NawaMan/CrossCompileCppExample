# Task-0001: Initial Project Setup

## Description
Set up the initial project structure and configuration for cross-compiling C++ code.

## Objectives
- Create the basic project directory structure
- Set up build system configuration with bash scripts
- Create Docker configuration for Linux x86_64 and ARM64
- Document the cross-compilation requirements

## Acceptance Criteria
- Project structure is established
- Bash build scripts are created for cross-compilation
- Docker configuration is in place for Linux x86_64 and ARM64
- Basic documentation is in place

## Status
Not Started

## Notes
This is the first task for the Cross Compile C++ Example project. As per project requirements, we will use bash scripts instead of CMake for the build system, and Docker for containerization.

## Constraints
- Use Clang compiler with C++ 23 standard or newer
- Bash scripts for build system (no CMake)
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Step-by-Step Actions

1. **Create Project Directory Structure**
   - Create `src` directory for C++ source files
   - Create `include` directory for header files
   - Create `scripts` directory for build scripts
   - Create `docker` directory for Docker configurations
   - Create `docs` directory for documentation

2. **Create Sample C++ Code**
   - Create a simple "Hello World" C++ program in `src`
   - Ensure it uses C++23 features to verify compiler support

3. **Create Build Scripts**
   - Create `scripts/build.sh` for building on Linux x86_64
   - Create `scripts/build-arm64.sh` for building on Linux ARM64
   - Include Clang compiler flags for C++23 support
   - Add cross-compilation flags for target architectures

4. **Create Docker Configurations**
   - Create `docker/x86_64.Dockerfile` for Linux x86_64 build environment
   - Create `docker/arm64.Dockerfile` for Linux ARM64 build environment
   - Include Clang installation and configuration

5. **Create Documentation**
   - Create `docs/setup.md` with setup instructions
   - Create `docs/build.md` with build instructions
   - Document cross-compilation process and requirements

6. **Create GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Create `.github/workflows/build.yml` for CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure workflow to build for Linux x86_64 and ARM64 initially
